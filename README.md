PROG 2500 WINDOWS PROGRAMMING – FINAL PROJECT
UWP APPLICATIONS


Assignment Value: 30% of overall course mark.

Due Dates: Project Proposal - Friday, April 5th

Project Demonstration, Team Journal and Peer Evaluation – Tuesday, April 23rd

Assignment Instructions:
As a team, propose, document and code a UWP application as described by the requirements of this assignment (see below).

This is a group project, each group should have 3 to 4 members. You may choose your own group, but the instructor has final say in group membership and may shuffle the teams at any time. If the group cannot decide on an application, the instructor will assign one. You want to avoid this. >=)

As this assignment is built around team collaboration, it is recommended that you use as many team collaboration tools as you can. I.e. host the project in github (private accounts available if not already provided) or Visual Studio Team Services, shared documents and demonstrate collaboration through assigning work items or tickets and show different branches for work.

Submission Instructions:
Proposal: One submission for the group, uploaded to the “Proposal” group dropbox.

Team Journal: Each student will keep a log of their own work. For the final Team Journal submission, all members’ logs should be combined in a single file, along with the other group journal requirements, then uploaded as a single submission to the “Journal” group dropbox. Note: Logs will be marked as a group, not individually.

Project Solution (Application Code): Add all final project files & resources to a .ZIP folder and submit a single submission for the group to the “Presentation” group dropbox.

Note: It is also recommended that each student push a copy of the final project to their own Git repositories, to retain a copy for their own code portfolio.

Peer & Self Evaluations: Each group member will download the provided member evaluation rubrics (.XLS file) complete evaluations for themselves and all other team members, then upload the completed evaluations file to the “Peer Evaluations” group dropbox.

Note: Team members who do not upload a peer/self evaluation file will receive a zero (0) for themselves and all other team members will receive full marks from the non-participating student.

Evaluation:
To insure the greatest chance of success on this assignment, be sure to check the marking rubrics at the end of this document or in Brightspace. The rubrics contain the criteria your instructor will be assessing when marking your assignment.

Program Requirements

As a group, build a UWP application that:

Consumes data asynchronously from a data source (web service)

See the following link for a source of web services https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis

Lists a summary of data with a separate details section for selected data.

Demonstrates proper use of main UWP course concepts, including databinding, command binding, user controls/custom dialogs.

Allows for filtering of data (i.e. by date, text, location, etc.).

Has at least three application Pages (ex. a details screen, an About page listing team members, etc.)

Uses a complex control to display information (i.e. images, web pages or multimedia)
